    <h3>Article Processing Charges (APC)</h3>
    <p>
      Bright Sphere Insights is an open access publisher, ensuring that all
      articles are freely accessible to readers worldwide without subscription
      fees. To maintain this publishing model and cover the costs of editorial
      management, peer review, production, indexing, online hosting, and
      long-term archiving, an Article Processing Charge (APC) is applied to
      accepted manuscripts.
    </p>
    <h3>1. When APC is Applied</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are no submission charges. Authors may submit and have their work
        reviewed free of cost.
      </li>
      <li>
        The APC is payable only after the manuscript is accepted for
        publication, following peer review and editorial approval.
      </li>
      <li>
        Payment of APC ensures that the article is published open access and
        remains permanently available online.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6>2. What APC Covers</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>The APC supports:</li>
      <li>Editorial and peer review management</li>
      <li>Professional copyediting and formatting</li>
      <li>High-quality typesetting and PDF/HTML production</li>
      <li>DOI assignment and indexing in major databases</li>
      <li>Long-term digital archiving for permanent access</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Waivers and Discounts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Authors from low-income countries or those with genuine financial
        difficulties may apply for partial or full APC waivers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Waivers are considered on a case-by-case basis and must be requested at
        the time of manuscript submission.
      </li>
      <li>
        The decision on waivers is at the discretion of the editorial office.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>4. Refund Policy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Since APC is charged only after acceptance, it is non-refundable once
        payment has been made.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>5. Transparency and Fairness</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        APC details, including the exact amount, will be made available on the
        journal’s website.
      </li>
      <li>There are no hidden charges beyond the stated APC.</li>
      <li>
        The editorial decision to accept or reject a manuscript is never
        influenced by the ability to pay the APC.
      </li>
